Uristocrat: Soil density data from:
http://www.pedosphere.com/resources/bulkdensity/worktable_us.cfm
 
In spite of the weird URL, the site is normal.
 
DF is based on the texture triangle, which you can see here:

All of these are actually mixes of sand, silt & clay.  Loam is a
roughly equal mix of all three.  So I'll give the percentages of
each that I used to find the density.  For example, SCS = 20/60/20
means that a soil was assumed to contain 20% sand, 60% clay & 20%
silt.  The numbers will always be in the order sand/clay/silt.
